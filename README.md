# CaptchaXtract

This project is a full-stack website that provides image-to-text conversion with USDT payment functionality. The project includes:

- A Python-based FastAPI backend for image processing and Tesseract OCR
- A React.js frontend with a modern, responsive design.
- User authentication with JWT and role management (/User/Admin).
- User and admin dimboards with UST wallet functionality. Users may pay for services using USDT, and admins can monitor all transactions.

The project will integrate external API keys to provide premium services (e.g., Text-to-Speech services).

The full-stack consists of:

1. Backend: FastAPI backend with Tesseract OCR and authentication using JWT.
2. Frontend: React.js frontend with Tailwind CSS/alternatives for responsive web design.
3. Blockchain Integration: Web3.js/Ethers.js for USDT transactions.
4. Deployment: Render/Vercel/Netlify for the backend, and Vercel/Netlify for the frontend.


Features to implement next:

- USDT payments with user account management.
- Admin tools to monitor usage and ban users.
- Real-time analytics of user apikey usage.
- User authentication and role management.

This structure will be committed in upcoming commits.
